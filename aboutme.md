### Who I am...
Hello my name is Anita Westfalewski and I am a Kinesiology student in my last year at the University of Calgary. My favourite classes through my undergrad degree have been KNES 323 and Pediatric Exercise Science!. I am very passionate about working with kids and hope to pursue a career in pediatrics, OT, or chiropractics, but before that I am hoping to take a year off from studying and explore the world! Some things I do outside of academics is coach children's multi-sport programs and volunteer with neurodivergent kids. Some things I love are rollerskating, snowboarding, and sleeping (although I don't have a very healthy sleep schedule as seen in my analysis [here](https://anita-westfalewski.github.io/381_FinalProject/excel/))
